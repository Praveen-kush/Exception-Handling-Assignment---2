    "Use Specific Exception Types: Catch and handle specific exceptions rather than using generic catch-all exceptions like Exception or BaseException. This helps you differentiate between different error scenarios and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep Exception Blocks Short: The code within an exception block should be minimal and focused on handling the error. Avoid including long sequences of code within a single try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Multiple except Blocks: If you need to handle different types of exceptions differently, use separate except blocks for each. This enhances code readability and allows you to provide specific error-handling logic for each exception type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Suppressing Exceptions: Don't use empty except blocks or catch exceptions and do nothing with them. It can make debugging and diagnosing issues challenging. At the very least, log or report the exception for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rethrow Exceptions Judiciously: In some cases, it's appropriate to catch an exception, perform some actions, and then re-raise the exception using raise. This can be useful for logging or adding context to an exception before propagating it further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use finally Blocks for Cleanup: When you need to ensure that certain actions are taken regardless of whether an exception is raised or not, use finally blocks. Common use cases include closing files, releasing resources, or cleaning up temporary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle Exceptions Close to the Source: Handle exceptions as close to the source of the error as possible. Don't catch an exception at a high level if you can handle it at a lower level where the issue occurred. This makes it easier to pinpoint and fix issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Exceptions: Use logging libraries (e.g., logging module) to log exceptions and their context. This provides valuable information for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Silent Failures: Don't let exceptions silently fail. When an error occurs, make sure it's reported, and the program exits gracefully or continues in a known state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Custom Exceptions: For specific error scenarios in your application, create custom exception classes that provide meaningful information and context. This helps improve code readability and maintainability.\n",

    "Document Exception Handling: Include comments or docstrings to document how and why specific exceptions are being handled in your code. This helps other developers understand your intent and design.\n",
